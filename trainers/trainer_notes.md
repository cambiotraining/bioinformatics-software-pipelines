  - Be clear to the participants that in exercise 2 they do not need to wait for the pipeline to finish (some take hours). The purpose is that they get the pipeline **running** successfully. Once most participants have it running, you can move on. 
  - While participants do the exercise, the lead trainer should get one of the workflows running on their terminal. This is so you have things done when it comes to wrap-up the exercise session.
- (15 min) Go through exercise solution and clarify issues that may have been brought up during exercise.
  - In the samplesheet exercise, we give them different ways to create the samplesheet, but you don't need to demonstrate each of these.
